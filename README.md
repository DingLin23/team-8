The function is coded in Python with the following modules required to be installed:
certifi==2019.9.11
chardet==3.0.4
idna==2.8
PyYAML==5.1.2
requests==2.22.0
urllib3==1.25.6

We utilized a ZOOM API to create a meeting and pull the url needed to be clicked by other users to join.

We returned the url and sent it to the function that was in charge of sending the email. The sendMail() function takes in the url generated by the previous function as well as a list of emails generated by the database for a particular event.

We sent the email using SMTP with a subject line as well as a descriptive body to let the user know the purpose of the email; we also validated that the email is valid.
